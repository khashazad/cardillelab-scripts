# cardillelab-scripts

A collection of Python scripts and tools for environmental data processing, satellite data analysis, and geospatial research. These scripts are designed to handle large-scale environmental datasets by integrating with Google Cloud Storage and MongoDB servers. They facilitate the parsing and pre-processing of raw satellite imagery, enabling efficient workflows for land cover classification, time-series analysis, and data filtering.

## Overview

This repository hosts a set of Python scripts designed to streamline and automate workflows related to environmental data analysis and satellite imagery processing. Key functionalities include:

- Google Cloud Integration: Tools for efficiently accessing and managing large datasets stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
- MongoDB Server Access: Scripts for interacting with MongoDB, enabling the storage, retrieval, and processing of extensive environmental datasets.

- Satellite Imagery Parsing: Utilities to parse raw satellite imagery, handling essential pre-processing tasks such data transormation, filtering, and scaling for further analysis.
